Argot C#
--------

This is the C# version of the Argot runtime library.



Requirements
------------

The Argot library itself has no dependencies on external libraries
other than those supplied with C# itself.

To build and run the test cases you require Nunit. Nunit is available
at http://www.nunit.org/

The project includes a Nant script for command line building of the
source package.  Nant is available from http://nant.sourceforge.net/


Building Argot C# on Windows.
-----------------------------

To build the C# version of Argot, please use the Argot.sln solution
file with Microsoft visual Studio.  

To build and test the package from the command line you can NAnt:

nant test


To build directly on the command line with only csc you can enter from the 
csharp directory:

csc /target:library /out:argot.dll /unsafe src\*.cs src\argot\*.cs src\argot\common\*.cs src\argot\meta\*.cs src\argot\util\*.cs src\argot\dictionary\*.cs



Building Argot C# using Mono.
-----------------------------

We haven't used mono yet.  Please let us know if you have successfully
compiled and used Argot with mono.
